Complete solutions for Coursera [Machine Learning] programming assignments for session 06-Feb-2017 to 01-May-2017.

### You may find
- Octave programming expertise level is more in later assignments than in earlier assignments i.e. more vectorized implementation in later part.
- Some variables are used verbose way which is intentional for understanding with actual lecture and problem description.

### Note
This is my own work and for reference only. Anyone who take the course should follow Courseras [Honor Code]
